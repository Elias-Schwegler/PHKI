Philosophy, Art, and Artificial Intelligence (PHKI û FS26)
Shaelom Fischer (MV), Guillaume Massol, Catherine Hayden
Module Overview
This module explores the connections between  philosophy, art, and artificial intelligence (AI) . Together weÆll explore some of the most pressing questions
raised by this powerful technollogy. We will consider how philosophers approach the concepts of AI and creativity, asking what it means for something to be
called ôartö when it is created by a machine. We will also examine how AI is shaping our world today and what its portrayal in film, TV, and othe rmedia
reveals about societyÆs hopes and fears. Students will be encouraged to reflect critically on their own values and beliefs and how their understanding of AI is
shaped by them.
By the end of the course, students will have a deeper perspective on AIÆs creative potential, its societal impact, and its implications for culture.
Use of AI in Course Materials
Some of the course materials, including lecture slides, prompts, and examples, were created with the assistance of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, DALL-E, Gemini).
All materials have been reviewed, edited, and approved by the lecturers. The purpose of this disclosure is to model the same transparency we expect from
students: if you use AI tools in your assignments, you must clearly state which tools you used, how you used them, and what role they played in shaping your
work.

Assignments
In the Philosophy, Art, and AI course, students will have the opportunity to engage in two assignments throughout the semester:
1) Digital Projects:  Students will create a piece of digital art using an AI tool (e.g., AI image generator, text-to-speech, language model). This could be
visual art, music, poetry, or mixed media. They will then write an analytical report analyzing their creation process, the role of AI in their art, and how
their work reflects philosophical and cultural themes discussed in the course.
2) Group Videos:  Students will examine how AI is portrayed in the media and different art forms and connect it to the various topics covered in the
module. The primary objective is to analyze and discuss what these portrayals reveal about society's perceptions and viewpoints regarding AI. By
critically exploring the artistic representations of AI, students will uncover valuable insights into the societal implications associated with this emerging
technology. After group videos have been submitted and viewed by their lecturer, each group will participate in an oral discussion with their lecturer
on the topic of their presentation.
Assignments/Marks breakdown:
1)   Digital Projects + Report: 40% -  due  25.04.26
2)   Micro-vivas + Group Videos: 60%
a.   Micro-viva Prep Sheet due 22.05.26
b.   Group Videos (Assignment 2) due 20.06.2026
We look forward to a successful and eye-opening semester with you all!

Assignments Overview & Details
AI Use in PHKI
Good scientific research requires clearly outlining the process of text creation, as emphasised in our HSLU guidelines on scientific misconduct and plagiarism. (See
æInformation and AdministrationÆ folder on ILIAS.) Therefore, you are expected to be transparent about your use of AI tools in both assignments. This information must be
included in a ædisclaimerÆ section at the end of each assignment. Specify which tools you used, their purpose, and how you applied each one.
Assignment 1: Digital Projects + Reports (40%)
*  due on 25.04.26
Task:  Students will create a piece of digital art using an AI tool (e.g., AI image generator, text-to-speech, language model). This could be visual art, music, poetry, or mixed
media. They will then write an analytical report analyzing their creation process, the role of AI in their art, and how their work reflects cultural and philosophical themes
discussed so far in the course.
Please note that this assignment must be completed in English .
Instructions:
1.   Select AI Tool:  Choose an AI tool suitable for your chosen art form (e.g., image generator, text-to-speech, language model etc.).
2.   Create Artwork : Use the selected AI tool to create a piece of digital art. This could be visual art, music, poetry, or mixed media.
3.   Write Analytical Report : Reflect on your creation process, the influence of AI on your artwork, and how your work relates to cultural and philosophical themes
discussed in the course. Your report should be detailed and insightful.
4.   Present Artwork : During class, present your digital artwork to your peers. Be prepared to discuss your analytical report and answer questions about your creative
process and the themes explored in your artwork.
