# PHKI – Philosophy, Art, and Artificial Intelligence

## Week 01 | 17 February 2026 | *Intro to Philosophy, Art and AI* | Lecturer: Shaelom Fischer (SF)

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After this week, students should be able to:

- **Define art** in multiple ways, recognising the breadth of media that count as art (painting, music, film, video games, architecture, memes, AI-generated images, etc.)
- **Use basic philosophical analysis tools** — clarifying concepts, testing arguments, finding hidden assumptions, and examining values
- **Argue for or against AI as an artist**, drawing on different definitions of art and creativity
- **Reflect on personal values in art** — what qualities you prize (emotion, skill, intention, beauty) and whether AI can deliver them
- **Evaluate process vs. result** in creativity — does it matter *how* art was made, or only *what* the final work is?
- **State what Assignment 1 expects** and know where to find all PHKI course information (Syllabus, Projects brief, ILIAS)

---

## 📌 Module Overview & Assessment Structure

> **Key insight:** PHKI is a **discussion-based** module with **no exam**. The weekly workload is light — most of the learning happens *in class* through debate and reflection. The slides often look more extensive than they are (many contain only images or discussion prompts).

### Module Character

- ❌ No exam — assessment is **100% project-based**
- ❌ No weekly coding assignments
- ❌ No heavy homework — typically just one resource to read/watch per week
- ✅ Emphasis on **in-class discussion**, critical thinking, and personal reflection
- ✅ Three main themes: **AI and the Nature of Art**, **AI in Society**, **AI and Personal Beliefs**
- ✅ Three lecturers: **Shaelom Fischer** (SF, module lead), **Guillaume Massol** (GM), **Catherine Hayden** (CH)

### Assessment at a Glance

## 🧠 Key Concepts & Definitions

| Concept / Term | Definition | Origin / Thinker | Relevance to AI |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Philosophy** | The discipline that clarifies concepts, tests arguments, exposes hidden assumptions, and examines values | Ancient Greek tradition (φιλοσοφία — love of wisdom) | Provides the critical toolkit to evaluate AI's role in society, art, and human identity |
| **Art (broad definition)** | Human creative expression across any medium — painting, music, poetry, film, video games, architecture, fashion, digital media, memes, AI-generated images, interactive media | Expanded definition used in PHKI (slide 5) | AI blurs the boundary of what counts as art; if memes and digital media are art, can AI outputs be too? |
| **Process vs. Result** | The philosophical distinction between valuing *how* something was created (the journey, intention, skill) versus valuing *what* was produced (the finished work, its effects) | Aesthetics / Philosophy of Art | Central to the AI art debate: if an AI produces a beautiful painting, does the lack of human process diminish it? |
| **Intention & Meaning** | The idea that true art requires conscious intention and embedded meaning from a sentient creator | Intentionalism in aesthetics | AI lacks conscious intention — does this disqualify its outputs from being "art"? |
| **Pattern Remixing** | A critical characterisation of AI art as recombination of learned patterns rather than genuine creation | Contemporary AI art criticism | Challenges the view that AI is "creative" — it may just be sophisticated interpolation |
| **Creative Ownership** | The question of who deserves credit — the prompter, the AI company, or the artists whose work trained the model | Copyright law, ethics of AI | Directly relevant to Assignment 1 and to the "in the style of…" discussion |
| **Critical Thinking** | Questioning one's own assumptions, engaging with opposing views, and seeking evidence-based conclusions | Epistemology; Socratic method | PHKI's core expectation — students should not accept claims uncritically, including about AI |
| **Three Lenses (Philosophical, Economic, Institutional)** | Framework for examining AI art from multiple perspectives: what it means, who profits, and who gatekeeps | Introduced in PHKI W1 (slide 25) | Structures analysis for essays, discussions, and the micro-viva |

## 💡 Philosophical Arguments & Positions

### 1. Why Philosophy Belongs in an AI/ML Degree

- **Thesis:** AI development raises profound philosophical questions that technical training alone cannot address.
- **Reasoning:** As Demis Hassabis (co-founder of Google DeepMind, Nobel Prize winner) stated: *"I want to understand the big questions… I thought building AI would be the fastest route to answer some of those questions."* Philosophy provides tools to grapple with questions about consciousness, creativity, ethics, and human identity — all of which are at stake in AI development.
- **Counter-argument:** Some argue that philosophy is impractical for engineers — code solves problems, not abstract debate.
- **Application to AI:** Understanding *what* intelligence, creativity, or art *is* determines how we design and evaluate AI systems. Without philosophical clarity, we risk building tools we cannot meaningfully assess.

### 2. Can AI Create Art?

- **Thesis (Pro):** AI can produce outputs that are visually, musically, or emotionally indistinguishable from human-created art. If the result moves people, it is art.
- **Reasoning:** The Gallery Walk demonstrated that audiences respond emotionally to works without knowing whether a human or machine created them. If emotional impact defines art, AI qualifies.
- **Counter-argument:** Art requires *intention* and *meaning*. AI has no consciousness, no life experience, and no purpose — it produces patterns, not meaning. Its outputs are "pattern remixing," not creation.
- **Application to AI:** This debate directly frames Assignment 1 — students must create AI art and reflect on whether their collaboration with AI constitutes genuine artistic creation.

### 3. Process vs. Result in Creativity

- **Thesis:** The creative *process* (struggle, intention, decision-making, revision) is what gives art its value — not the final product alone.
- **Reasoning:** A painting by a human who spent months refining their vision carries a different kind of value than an identical image generated in seconds by Midjourney. The process encodes human experience.
- **Counter-argument:** Audiences rarely know or care about the process. A beautiful photograph is beautiful regardless of whether the photographer spent hours setting up the shot or got lucky. Similarly, an AI image that moves people has achieved art's purpose.
- **Application to AI:** This tension runs through the entire PHKI module. Assignment 1 explicitly asks students to reflect on the creative process — not just submit a product.

### 4. The Three Lenses for the Future of Art

The slides introduce a structured framework for analysing AI art:

#### Philosophical Lens
- **Question:** If art is about intention and meaning, does AI art qualify? Or is it "pattern remixing"?
- **Implication:** Forces us to interrogate our *definition* of art before evaluating AI's role in it.

#### Economic Lens
- **Question:** Who gets paid, credited, or protected? The prompter? The AI company? The training-data artists?
- **Implication:** AI art disrupts traditional economic models. Artists whose work trained models receive no compensation; prompters claim authorship for minimal effort; AI companies profit from the entire ecosystem.

#### Institutional Lens
- **Question:** Will museums, galleries, and competitions accept AI art?
- **Implication:** Institutional gatekeeping shapes what is culturally recognised as "art." The case of Jason Allen winning the Colorado State Fair with *Théâtre D'opéra Spatial* (Midjourney) exemplifies this tension.

## 🗣️ Discussion Building Blocks

### Pro-Arguments (AI can be an artist)

- "If the purpose of art is to evoke emotion and provoke thought, then AI art succeeds — audiences respond to it without knowing or caring about its origin."
- "Art has always been mediated by technology — from the printing press to photography to digital editing. AI is simply the next tool in this continuum."
- "The prompter's creative vision, combined with iterative refinement, constitutes a genuine creative process — just as a photographer *chooses* rather than *paints*."

### Counter-Arguments (AI cannot be an artist)

- "Art requires conscious intention and lived experience. An AI has neither — its outputs are statistical artefacts, not expressions of meaning."
- "If everyone can generate images with a text prompt, art loses the scarcity and skill that give it cultural value."
- "AI art is built on the unpaid labour of human artists whose works were scraped into training datasets — this is exploitation, not creation."

### Bridging Statements

- "Perhaps the question is not whether AI *is* an artist, but whether the *collaboration* between human and AI constitutes a new form of creative practice."
- "We can value AI art aesthetically while still recognising that it raises serious ethical and economic concerns for human artists."
- "The debate may ultimately hinge on what we *want* art to be — a mirror of human experience, or a source of beauty regardless of origin."

### Critical Questions

- Who benefits when we call AI outputs "art" — the prompter, the AI company, or society?
- If you cannot tell whether a painting was made by a human or AI, does the answer to that question change its value? Why?
- Is the discomfort many feel about AI art rooted in a genuine philosophical objection, or in a fear of economic displacement?
- Should artists have the right to opt out of training datasets — and what would the consequences be?

## 🔗 Thematic Connections

| This Week's Topic | Connects To | How |
|---|---|---|
| Definition of art | **W07 Digital Creativity** (GM) | W1 establishes what "art" means; W7 explores whether AI processes qualify as "creative" |
| Process vs. result | **W06 Nature of Learning** (GM) | W6 contrasts human learning with machine prediction — parallel to process vs. output in art |
| Creative ownership / copyright | **W04 Critical Theory** (CH) | W4 examines power and ideology in algorithms — who benefits from AI art mirrors who benefits from AI data |
| Philosophical / Economic / Institutional lenses | **W10–11 AI in Media** (SF) | The three lenses introduced here structure the media analysis required for Assignment 2 |
| What we value in art | **W12 Current Society** (CH) | Personalisation and echo chambers shape how art is consumed — AI accelerates this |
| Human agency & authenticity | **Module-wide recurring theme** | W1 introduces the core question: does AI diminish human agency and authentic expression? |

## 📋 In-Class Activities Summary

### Activity 1: Gallery Walk — "What do you value in different art mediums?"

- **Description:** Students viewed 10 works across different media (film, painting, architecture, performance art, video games, music, drones, photography, poetry). For each, they answered: *(1) What are your impressions? How does it make you feel? (2) What stands out?*
- **Purpose:** To surface personal aesthetic values before any philosophical framework is applied — creating an honest baseline of what students care about in art.
- **Discussion Prompts (in pairs/small groups):**
  - How do you differ from your partner in what you value?
  - Can AI create, tap into, or evoke these qualities as well?
  - Would you care if/that they were AI-created?
- **Key Takeaway:** Different people value different things in art (skill, emotion, novelty, beauty, message). Understanding your own values is essential before evaluating whether AI can deliver them.

### Activity 2: Opinion Spectrum — AI Art Statements

- **Description:** Students positioned themselves on a "Strongly Disagree ↔ Strongly Agree" spectrum for 8 provocative statements:
  1. "AI art should be displayed alongside traditional art in museums."
  2. "I would pay the same for AI art as for human-created art."
  3. "It matters to me whether art was created by a human."
  4. "AI art can evoke genuine human emotions."
  5. "If everyone can generate art with AI, then art loses its value."
  6. "AI art challenges what it means to be creative."
  7. "Artists should have the right to opt-out of training datasets."
  8. "The future of art will be AI-human collaboration, not replacement."
- **Purpose:** To make personal positions visible and debatable — a starting point for developing nuanced philosophical arguments over the semester.
- **Key Takeaway:** Most positions are defensible; the value lies in *why* you hold a position, not just *that* you hold it.

### Activity 3: Resource Preparation for Week 2

- **Task:** Pick one of six provided resources (papers, articles, podcasts, videos) and prepare to discuss: *(1) What is the main argument? (2) What future does it imagine? (3) Do you agree?*
- **Tip from the slides:** "Take note of each publisher/company. Is it possible that they are trying to push a certain narrative? Who is funding them?" — introduction to critical source evaluation.

### Assignment 2: Group Videos + Micro-viva (60%) — due 20.06.2026

| This Week's Content | How It Helps |
|---|---|
| **Three lenses** | The philosophical/economic/institutional framework is directly applicable to analysing how AI is portrayed in any media form |
| **Opinion spectrum statements** | These 8 statements map onto common media portrayals of AI — use them as analytical anchors |
| **Resource evaluation tip** | "Who is funding this narrative?" — essential critical skill for the research component |
| **Discussion building blocks** | The pro/counter/bridging arguments from this summary are directly usable in the micro-viva |

### 🛠️ AI Use Guidelines (Slide 21)

The lecturer set clear rules for how AI may be used in PHKI:

- ✅ **State what AI tool you used and how** — e.g. *"I used Gemini to brainstorm ideas for ..., but I wrote and revised the report myself."*
- ✅ **Digital Projects (A1):** Using AI is **required**, but you must reflect on *how* and *why*
- ✅ **Reports:** Use **your own words and analysis** — the lecturers need to assess that *you* reached the learning objectives
- ⛔ **Don't use prompts like "in the style of..."** — respect creative ownership
- ❓ **When in doubt, ask** — better to clarify than risk poor marks
- 📝 **AI Disclaimer required** at the end of every assignment (which tools, their purpose, how applied)

## 💭 Reflection Prompts

1. **During the Gallery Walk, which work moved you most — and why?** What does your answer reveal about what you value in art? Could an AI produce something that moves you in the same way?

2. **If a friend showed you a stunning painting and you later discovered it was AI-generated, would your feelings about it change?** What does this reveal about whether you prioritise *process* or *result* in art?

3. **Demis Hassabis claims that AI is the fastest route to answering philosophy's big questions. Do you agree?** Or does AI simply raise new questions without answering old ones?

4. **Consider the opinion statement: "Artists should have the right to opt-out of training datasets."** What would the practical consequences be? Would this protect artists or simply slow AI development while other countries continue?

5. **The slides ask: "Who gets paid, credited, or protected?"** Think about a specific AI art tool you have used or seen. Trace the chain of value: whose work trained it, who profits from it, and who gets creative credit. Is this arrangement just?
